8.)
    a.)
        An O(N^2) algorithm for this problem would be to add every given number to every 
        other given number and see whether the result is K, returning true as soon as a 
        valid pair is found.

    b.)
        An O(NlogN) algorithm for this problem would be to first sort the array using one 
        of several existing O(NlogN) sorting algorithms (such as std::sort() in C++).

        Then for each item x in the array, use a binary search to see whether K-x exists 
        in the array.
